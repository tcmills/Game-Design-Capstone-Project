# Game Design Capstone Project
 
To the Magic Shop is a simulation game where you play as the shopkeeper of a magic store in a fantasy setting. The gameplay is similar to Papers Please or a cooking simulator game, where you must first figure out what the customer needs and then use your knowledge and materials to create spells to meet those needs. However, the main gameplay element is the complex spell crafting system that the player will be able to learn and explore as they progress. The player wins if they make a certain amount of gold each day by being quick about creating their spells. I am currently developing this game for fun and plan to release it on PC through itch.io.
